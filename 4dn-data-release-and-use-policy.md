# 4D Nucleome Project - Data Release and Use Policy

Version 1 - 19 December 2017

- - -

The 4D Nucleome Data Release and Use Policy will be reviewed and, if necessary, updated on a semi-annual basis.

- - -

_Rationale: To catalyze research within and outside the 4D Nucleome network and to provide a rich community resource._

This document describes the 4DN network policy for releasing data, both internally and to the public. All data generated as part of a 4DN-funded project are subject to this policy. 
This policy encourages the open sharing of data generated by the 4DN program. Many groups in 4DN are engaged in developing new technologies for investigating the dynamics of the 3-dimensional organization of the nucleus. All data needs to be shared with the 4DN DCIC as soon as possible after it has been generated. For data release, the policy differentiates between data generated with more established assays with agreed-upon standards, and data generated with emerging technologies, which require more internal vetting prior to public release. 

__Production Data__ is defined as an established data type which has an approved metadata model and a common protocol that has been approved by the 4DN Steering Committee. 

__Technology Development__ Data is defined as an emerging data type for which a working protocol is available in PDF format, but no approved metadata model exists. As novel technologies developed in 4DN become more refined and standardized, these data types may be reclassified as production data. 

Once a protocol has officially been approved for a technology development data type and a metadata model has been implemented, the data type will become a production data type. Any previously submitted data for such data types will immediately be made publicly available using the quality flags provided by the submitter.

## Data Release Schedule

As a general rule, any 4D Nucleome data used in a manuscript submitted to a preprint server must be publicly available at that time. 

### Production Data

Production data and associated metadata will be shared internally immediately following completion of the submission to the DCIC. 

Production data and associated metadata will be shared with the public as rapidly as possible:
-	_Option 1_: Immediately after completion of the submission using quality flags provided by the submitter if no automated QC pipeline has been implemented at the 4DN DCIC.
-	_Option 2_: Within 7 days after completion of the 4DN DCIC QC pipeline or after vetting and sign-off by the data producer, whichever comes first, using quality flags generated by the pipeline.

### Technology Development Data

Technology development data will be shared internally immediately following completion of the submission to the DCIC.

Technology development data will be shared with the public:
-	_Option 1_: When a manuscript describing these data is submitted to a preprint server, in accordance with the 4DN Publication Policy.
-	_Option 2_: When the data producer requests that it is shared with the public. 

## Considerations for Use of 4DN Data

__Unrestricted use of public data by external users__: External data users may freely download, analyze, and publish results based on public 4DN datasets without restriction. Researchers using public, but as yet unpublished 4DN data must contact the specific data producer to discuss possible coordinated publication. Unpublished data are those that have never been described and referenced by a peer-reviewed publication. Use of 4DN data must be cited as described below.

__Use of internally shared data by 4DN network members__: 4DN network members have access to technology development data prior to public release. Use of these data in a publication prior to public release must be accomplished as a collaboration with the data producer. Compliance with this policy will be monitored and failure to abide by this policy will be reported to the 4DN Steering Committee and Program Directors.

__Citation of 4DN data__: Any data and data products released by the network must be referenced using the official accession numbers provided by the 4D Nucleome DCIC. Manuscripts using data released by the network __must also cite (1) the latest network-wide publication (doi:10.1038/nature23884)__ and __(2) all relevant publications and preprints describing 4D Nucleome data referenced in the manuscript__. The corresponding 4D Nucleome Network data production centers or labs must be acknowledged.
